Here's why you should separate the RAG service:
Resource Management
RAG operations can be resource-intensive
Vector databases need dedicated storage
Image processing requires specific dependencies
Easier to scale independently
Deployment Flexibility
Can deploy on specialized hardware if needed
Easier to manage GPU resources if required
Can scale independently from main application
Maintenance
Cleaner separation of concerns
Easier to update ML models and embeddings
Independent versioning of ML-related dependencies
